# Conditional_statements
**Aim**: To study and implement C++ decision making statements.

**Theory**: Decision-making statements in C++ are used to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions. Common decision-making structures include if, if-else, else-if, and switch statements. These allow the program to choose different paths of execution depending on the evaluation of boolean expressions, enabling dynamic and flexible behavior in code. These are handly in big programs also and helps in developing logical skills as well.
